WARNING:tensorflow:Layer maml is casting an input tensor from dtype float16 to the layer's dtype of float32, which is new behavior in TensorFlow 2.  The layer has dtype float32 because it's dtype defaults to floatx.

If you intended to run this layer in float32, you can safely ignore this warning. If in doubt, this warning is likely only an issue if you are porting a TensorFlow 1.X model to TensorFlow 2.

To change all layers to have dtype float16 by default, call `tf.keras.backend.set_floatx('float16')`. To change just this layer, pass dtype='float16' to the layer constructor. If you are the author of this layer, you can disable autocasting by passing autocast=False to the base Layer constructor.

A list element was replaced (__setitem__, __setslice__), deleted (__delitem__, __delslice__), or moved (sort). In order to support restoration on object creation, tracking is exclusively for append-only data structures.

If you don't need this list checkpointed, wrap it in a tf.contrib.checkpoint.NoDependency object; it will be automatically un-wrapped and subsequently ignored.
